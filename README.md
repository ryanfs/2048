# [2048 in Color](http://ryanfs.github.io/2048/)

* JavaScript interface independent of a backend.
* Uses a functional JS model independent of the interface.
* Integrate the JS model with the HTML interface.
* Use the Mousetrap.js library to bind keyboard events.

## Summary

This project (done at Dev Bootcamp) was to build a clone of the game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

The workflow was to play 2048 a few times to get more familiar with the rules, and then code it from scratch.

Features To Come:
* Starting a new game.
* Storing the game in LocalStorage so that it still shows up if you close the tab.
